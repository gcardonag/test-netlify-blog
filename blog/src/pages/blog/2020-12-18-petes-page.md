## I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night\

Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife\
And if it was an open-shut case\
I never would've known from that look on your face\
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

*The more that you say*\
*The less I know*\
*Wherever you stray*\
*I follow*\
*I'm begging for you to take my hand*\
*Wreck my plans*\
*That's my man*
